## About The Project

This project is an app that pulls data from a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

I used the notebook to complete my analysis of a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the `etf.db` database, which the `Starter_Code` folder also contains.

I Analyzed the daily returns of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. Then deployed the visualizations to a web application by using the Voilà library.

The detailed instructions are divided into the following parts:

* Analyzing a single asset in the ETF

* Optimize data access with Advanced SQL queries

* Analyzing the ETF portfolio

* Deploying the notebook as a web application

I used the Voilà library to deploy the notebook as a web application.
